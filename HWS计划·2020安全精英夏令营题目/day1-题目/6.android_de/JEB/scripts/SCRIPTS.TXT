> SCRIPTS

This directory contains scripts for JEB clients. It comes with a set of sample
scripts publicly available on our GitHub repository, here:
https://github.com/pnfsoftware/jeb2-samplecode/tree/master/scripts

The official UI desktop client allows Python script execution via the Jython
package. (Note: scripts should not be confused with plugins, although they use
similar APIs.)

In order to run scripts, a Jython package is required.

Setting up Jython:
- Download a stand-alone Jython package from http://www.jython.org/downloads.html
  We recommend either version 2.5 (fastest) or version 2.7 (latest)
- Drop the downloaded 'jython-standalone-???.jar' file in the scripts/
  sub-directory located in your JEB installation directory
- Make sure that the client property '.ScriptsFolder' refers to that directory
  (it is the case by default; use 'Edit/Options, Advanced...' to verify this)

How to use:
- Scripts can be executed via the 'File/Scripts/Execute...' menu command
- Note that JEB scripts significantly differ from JEB1 scripts. Refer to the
  JEB developer portal for tutorials and APIs documentation:
  https://www.pnfsoftware.com/jeb/devportal
- Scripts should not be used for heavy-lifting operations. They are meant to
  execute small tasks within a the context of a JEB client.
