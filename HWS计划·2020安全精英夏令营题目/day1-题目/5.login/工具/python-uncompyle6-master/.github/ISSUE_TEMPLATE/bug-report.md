name: Bug report
about: Tell us about uncompyle6 bugs

---

<!-- __Note:__ Have you read https://github.com/rocky/python-uncompyle6/blob/master/HOW-TO-REPORT-A-BUG.md ?

Please remove any of the optional sections if they are not applicable.

Prerequisites

* Make sure the bytecode you have can be disassembled with a
  disassembler and produces valid results.
* Don't put bytecode and corresponding source code on any service that
  requires registration to download.
* When you open a bug report there is no privacy. If the legitimacy of
  the activity is deemed suspicous, I may flag it as suspicious,
  making the issue even more easy to detect.

Bug reports that violate a prerequisite may be discarded.

Note that there are way more bug-fix requestors than there are bug
fixers. If you want you need more immediate, confidential or urgent
assistance

http://www.crazy-compilers.com/decompyle/ offers a byte-code
decompiler service for versions of Python up to 2.6.

## Description

<!-- Add a clear and concise description of the bug. -->

## How to Reproduce

<!-- Please show both the *input* you gave and the
output you got in describing how to reproduce the bug:

or give a complete console log with input and output

```console
$ uncompyle6 <command-line-options>
...
$
```

Provide links to the Python bytecode. For example you can create a
gist with the information. If you have the correct source code, you
can add that too.

## Expected behavior

<!-- Add a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen. -->

## Environment

<!-- _This section sometimes is optional but helpful to us._

Please modify for your setup

- Uncompyle6 version: output from  `uncompyle6 --version` or `pip show uncompyle6`
- Python version for the version of Python the byte-compiled the file: `python -c "import sys; print(sys.version)"` where `python` is the correct Cpython or Pypy binary.
- OS and Version: [e.g. Ubuntu bionic]
